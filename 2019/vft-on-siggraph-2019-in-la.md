I am really happy to share with you that my graduation project [VFX Fractal Toolkit](https://github.com/jtomori/vft) was accepted into [Posters Session](https://s2019.siggraph.org/presentation/?sess=sess175&id=pos_114#038;id=pos_114) at Siggraph 2019 in Los Angeles.

Moreover it was featured in **Posters Preview: SIGGRAPH 2019** video!
