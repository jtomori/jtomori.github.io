I would like to share my graduation project **VFX Fractal Toolkit**. I finished my [TD](https://animationsinstitut.de/en/curriculum/animation/technical-director/technical-directing/) studies at [Filmakademie](https://www.filmakademie.de/en/) last month and had a chance to present the results at the last FMX. You can find out more about the **VFT** [here](https://github.com/jtomori/vft), where you can also check the code.
