I was happy to [contribute to Arnold documentation](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/A5AFHUG/Rendering+Volumetric+Fractals+With+OSL) with a tutorial describing rendering of volumetric fractals with Open Shading Language.

I start with simple examples such as rendering implicit volumes, then translate a sphere example into OSL. Afterwards I build a Mandelbulb OSL shader and add orbit traps for coloring.

Take a look and play with example file! More fractal shapes can be added with this technique and they can result in plenty of weird shapes :)

I also tested rendering in GPU mode and it worked out of the box, no additional steps needed.
