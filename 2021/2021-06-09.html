[ <- ](..) _2021-06-09_

I am always amused when I come across a library which name matches `Open*` pattern. This pattern seems to be popular especially in the field of computer graphics, vision and parallel programming. 

So I decided to collect descriptions of a couple of libraries in this post:

[OpenMV](https://openmv.io/)
:   The OpenMV project is about creating low-cost, extensible, Python powered, machine vision modules and aims at becoming the "Arduino of Machine Vision".

[OpenMVG](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~moulonp/openMVG/)
:   "Open Multiple View Geometry" is a library for computer-vision scientists and especially targeted to the Multiple View Geometry community. It is designed to provide an easy access to the classical problem solvers in Multiple View Geometry and solve them accurately.

[OpenGV](https://laurentkneip.github.io/opengv/)
:   The OpenGV library aims at unifying geometric computer vision algorithms for calibrated camera pose computation within a single efficient C++-library. OpenGV stands for Open Geometric Vision. 

[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
:   OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive 2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms.

[OpenGP](https://github.com/OpenGP/OpenGP) <small>(discontiunited)</small>
:   OpenGP is a C++11 open source library for geometry processing. It has been designed and implemented with a focus on ease of use and performance while maintaining high flexibility.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
:   OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)
:   OpenCL™ (Open Computing Language) is an open, royalty-free standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of diverse accelerators found in supercomputers, cloud servers, personal computers, mobile devices and embedded platforms.

[OpenCG](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/109865)
:   OpenCG is a free, open source library with an easy-to-use Python interface to provide nuclear engineers a single, powerful framework for modeling complex reactor geometries.

[OpenMC](https://openmc.org/)
:   OpenMC is a community-developed Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport code.

[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)
:   The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. The OpenMP API defines a portable, scalable model with a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications on platforms from the desktop to the supercomputer.

[OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)
:   The Open MPI Project is an open source Message Passing Interface implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners.

[OpenML](https://www.khronos.org/openml/)
:   OpenML® is a cross-platform standard programming environment for capturing, transporting, processing, displaying, and synchronizing digital media (2D and 3D graphics, audio and video processing, I/O, and networking).

I also made a graph:

If you are making a library in the field of computer graphics, vision or parallel programming then let me propose you a few names for your project:

* **OpenLI**
* **OpenPM**

I will write about projects matching `Open*IO` some other day.
