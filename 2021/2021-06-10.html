[ <- ](..) _2021-06-10_

Pick randomly from the following...

* The original Utah teapot model had no base, it was ~33% taller _(one explanation is that Jim Blinn compensated for non-square pixels by actually scaling the model and his model was more widely distributed)_
* Utah teapot is also accompanied by a spoon, cup (too without a base) and a saucer
* You can actually buy the Utah teapot, made by the same company (1.4 L version)
* Camera near and far clipping planes are also called "hither" and "yon" clipping planes
* Mip is an acronym of the Latin phrase "multum in parvo", meaning "much in little"
* Mipmapped texture takes around 33% more storage space
* In GLSL, components of a `vec4` can be accessed by `stpq`, along with `rgba`, `xyzw`

...until you are kicked out.
