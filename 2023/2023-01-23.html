**Some cool T-shirts**
[ <- ](..) _2023-01-23_

I've been collecting recently ideas for cool nerdy T-shirts. Mostly from areas of computer graphics, computer science, computer vision, geometry processing, visual effects etc.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/jtomori/nerdy_tshirts).

I've managed to print some of them and they look good! Even managed to get some positive feedback :) They also work well as presents.

I'm open to suggestions, just file an issue, or PR.
