**Rez starter kit**
[ <- ](..) _2023-11-30_

[Rez](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez) can be quite useful in visual effects pipelines. It's a handy package and environment manager.

In this post I will list some helpful resources for getting started with rez. Rather than trying to explain how to work with it, I will link some resources and sample package repositories that might be helpful when setting it up.

**Docs, various resources**

- First and foremost take a look at the [rez documentation](https://rez.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez/discussions) contain a lot of useful info
- Make sure to join the rez channel in [ASWF's Slack](https://slack.aswf.io/)
  - Thanks for suggesting resources for this post!
- Colin Kennedy's [Rez Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCA6gmpw2jEIO9v6qyUGTwmbKMfPVxdW)
- [ASWF's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AcademySoftwareFoundation/search?query=rez)
- [rez-config](https://groups.google.com/g/rez-config) has a lot of information, some is outdated, but some threads have helped me understand how rez is meant to be used and how various studios have implemented it into their pipelines
  - It now [seems to be getting archived and migrated to ASWF](https://groups.google.com/g/rez-config/c/N07qCBtoQms)
- Marcus Ottosson's rez resources, experiments
  - Some information in those links is outdated, or not part of the official rez release, but reading through it helped me understand rez better and see some of the issues with rez as well
