**Volumetric video at scale @ FMX 2023**
[ <- ](..) _2023-11-27_

In April I've presented [our volumetric video work](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/news/dimension-fmx-2023) on _I Wanna Dance With Somebody_ at [FMX](https://fmx.de/en/program-2023/detail/event/26744).

I've really enjoyed this conference. I've met a lot of friends from my university. And I could share some interesting information about our pipeline that we've prepared in order to deliver the largest volumetric video production to date. I'm helping with building an efficient Houdini-based volumetric video pipeline and I've shared some of our capabilities and approaches in the presentation.

Anyway, the [IWD](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/work/i-wanna-dance-somebody-production) project was a blast and I'm looking forward to breaking our record :)
