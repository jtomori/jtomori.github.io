**Deleting Alembic file loaded in Houdini on Windows**
[ <- ](..) _2023-12-01_

This is a quick tip / quality of life improvement.

Let's say you have two Houdini sessions open on a Windows: the first one is exporting an Alembic file and the second one is reading it. If you try to delete / overwrite the Alembic file that is already loaded into the second Houdini session, it will fail.

We can confirm that Houdini is keeping the Alembic file open with the [File Locksmith](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/file-locksmith).

One option for fixing this is to close the second Houdini session, delete / overwrite the Alembic file and the start the session again.

But that is slow and unnecessary. There is a better way, in the second Houdini session:

1. Display a _Null SOP_ or another node, so that the geometry from the Alembic file is not visible in the viewport
  -  Alternatively you can keep the display flag on the _Alembic SOP_ node and switch to _Render View_, or another pane
2. Press the _Reload Geometry_ button on the _Alembic SOP_ node
3. Done, you can now delete / overwrite the Alembic file
