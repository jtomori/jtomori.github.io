**Volumetric video R&D**
[ <- ](..) _2023-11-29_

Dimension has [published an insight](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/news/NeRFs-volumetric-applications) into our R&D work in the area of volumetric video, digital humans and neural radiance fields. It also shows some neat colour work we did and a volumetric video being used in a virtual production stage.

A [similar article](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/news/volumetric-video-intersection-visual-effects-and-virtual-production) was published 1.5 years ago as well about our tooling and experiments.
