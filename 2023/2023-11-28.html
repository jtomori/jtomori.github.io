**Volumetric video @ Siggraph 2023**
[ <- ](..) _2023-11-28_

I was fortunate enough to [attend Siggraph](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/news/dimension-siggraph-2023) this year with our all-star team. It's been my second time at Siggraph in LA and it was great! The conference was packed with [cutting edge research](https://www.dimensionstudio.co/news/siggraph-2023-wrap), with a quite a bit of it dedicated to digital humans & volumetric video.

We've presented our work on [authentic crowds for _I Wanna Dance With Somebody_](https://s2023.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_385&sess=sess171) and [our collaboration with Arcturus](https://s2023.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=exs126&sess=sess508) in the space of volumetric video and virtual production.
