Feel free to check a tutorial I was preparing during last couple of days :) It contains a lot of useful snippets, with examples and explanations in comments. I included there things that I found confusing or not very clear. You might not need to remember all of this stuff, but now you know where to look it up.

[Link to the tutorial.](https://github.com/jtomori/vex_tutorial) You can take a look at the project HIP file, or use the website for a quick look and for reference.

Let me know what you think and suggestions and critique is welcome.
