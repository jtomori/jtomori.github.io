**Dimension, nvdiffrec, instant ngp @ Siggraph 2022**
[ <- ](..) _2022-08-10_

Hold on to your papers, Mike has made a great presentation at Siggraph about our efforts into increasing quality of our volumetric video assets with differential rendering and neural radiance fields.

Make sure to watch it, [the recording is available here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/siggraph2022-sigg22-s-13/) (requires a free account). The presentation includes a nice overview of relevant research and some of our early results.

We've showed our applications and extensions to [Extracting Triangular 3D Models, Materials, and Lighting From Images](https://nvlabs.github.io/nvdiffrec/) and [Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding](https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/) research projects.

Here are the _Two Minute Papers_ videos about those papers from NVIDIA: [nvdiffrec](https://youtu.be/5j8I7V6blqM), [instant ngp](https://youtu.be/j8tMk-GE8hY).

I was involved in the nvdiffrec experiments.

What a time to be alive!
