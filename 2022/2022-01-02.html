**Overclocked Raspberry Pi: performance and temperature**
[ <- ](..) _2022-01-02_

I have been recently playing with Raspberry Pi - mostly setting some services for personal use. One thing I was tempted to do was to increase its CPU frequency. I have never overclocked anything, but this seemed like an easy and safe thing to try. I was interested in its impact on performance and temperature - here are my findings.

I have Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in aluminum case with 2 fans.

# Default configuration

I've noted values of two commands with and without overclocking: `lscpu` and `vcgencmd measure_clock arm`.

`lscpu` displays useful information about CPU, including its frequency range and [BogoMIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BogoMips) (which I just learned about and I like its wiki page). The second command `vcgencmd measure_clock arm` "returns the current frequency of the specified clock".

~~~ bash
$ lscpu
...
CPU max MHz:         1800.0000
CPU min MHz:         600.0000
BogoMIPS:            324.00
...
$ vcgencmd measure_clock arm
frequency(48)=1800457088

# Overclocked

I've decided to overclock to 2 GHz, and I've added the following options into `/boot/config.txt`:

~~~ none linenumbers
# My changes: overclocking
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000
~~~

After reboot I've got the following CPU information:

~~~ bash
$ lscpu
...
CPU max MHz:         2000.0000
CPU min MHz:         600.0000
BogoMIPS:            360.00
...
$ vcgencmd measure_clock arm
frequency(48)=2000478464
~~~

Max CPU frequency got increased by ~ 11 %, from 1.8 GHz to 2.0 GHz.

# Results

I've checked various metrics for a period of 5 hours with and without overclocking. Raspberry Pi was under a similar steady load in both cases - majority of CPU time is spent on some image processing and passthrough recording of a couple of video streams. I assume that the indoor environment temperature is steady enough for this comparison and don't take it into consideration (nor do I control or measure it).
